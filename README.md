# DIY NAS for 10" rackmount enclosures

The goal of this project is to make it easier to set up a drive bay in a 10" rack and use it with a nearby PC or a miniPC in the rack.

## HDD Backplane

The HDD Backplane is designed for the cage designed by [heron on printables](https://www.printables.com/model/167158-hdd-cage-for-10-inch-rack/comments). It screws onto the back using the pre-existing mounting holes and requires a little clearence.

### I want one!

Fantastic, i have included the production files (with JLCPCB in mind) so that you can make this yourself for your home NAS dreams, find them in /HDD Backplane/production

Alternatively, you can buy one from me, assembled and validated for $25+p&p (in GBP equivalent). Please enquire with me at ben@ben-labs.co.uk and I will get one shipped to you (there might be a lead time if there is interest)
